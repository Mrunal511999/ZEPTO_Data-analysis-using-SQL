🛒 E-Commerce Inventory Analysis (Zepto)

This is a real-world Data Analyst Portfolio Project based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from Zepto — one of India’s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups.

The project mirrors how analysts work in real business settings: from raw data cleaning and exploration to generating insights that support decision-making in retail and e-commerce.

🎯 Project Objectives

-Import and clean raw inventory data into SQL.

-Explore and analyze data using SQL queries.

-Generate insights into pricing, stock availability, and discounts.

-Deliver actionable recommendations for inventory and pricing optimization.

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

SQL (MySQL) → Data cleaning, querying, aggregations, and analysis.

📂 Project Workflow

-Data Collection

-Raw CSV dataset scraped from Zepto’s inventory listings.

-Data Loading

-Imported into MySQL using LOAD DATA INFILE.

-Data Cleaning & Exploration

-Removed duplicates and missing values.

-Standardized column names and corrected data types.

-SQL Analysis

-Category-level stock and pricing breakdowns.

-Identification of high-discount items and stock-out trends.

-SKU count analysis for product assortment.

📌 Project Overview

The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

✅ Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database

✅ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies

✅ Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees

✅ Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue and more

📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was originally scraped from Zepto’s official product listings. It mimics what you’d typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility – exactly how real catalog data looks.

🧾 Columns:

sku_id: Unique identifier for each product entry (Synthetic Primary Key)

name: Product name as it appears on the app

category: Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.

mrp: Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ₹)

discountPercent: Discount applied on MRP

discountedSellingPrice: Final price after discount (also converted to ₹)

availableQuantity: Units available in inventory

weightInGms: Product weight in grams

outOfStock: Boolean flag indicating stock availability

quantity: Number of units per package (mixed with grams for loose produce)

🔧 Project Workflow
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what we do in this project:

1. Database & Table Creation
We start by creating a SQL table with appropriate data types:

CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);
2. Data Import
Loaded CSV using MySql's Table data import wizard import feature.


3. 🔍 Data Exploration
Counted the total number of records in the dataset

Viewed a sample of the dataset to understand structure and content

Checked for null values across all columns

Identified distinct product categories available in the dataset

Compared in-stock vs out-of-stock product counts

Detected products present multiple times, representing different SKUs

4. 🧹 Data Cleaning
Identified and removed rows where MRP or discounted selling price was zero

Converted mrp and discountedSellingPrice from paise to rupees for consistency and readability

5. 📊 Business Insights
Found top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage

Identified high-MRP products that are currently out of stock

Estimated potential revenue for each product category

Filtered expensive products (MRP > ₹500) with minimal discount

Ranked top 5 categories offering highest average discounts

Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products

Grouped products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk categories

Measured total inventory weight per product category
